# Code Of Conduct

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participants within the cyber•Congress community, as well as steps for reporting unacceptable behavior. We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all and expect our code of conduct to be honored.

Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be immediately ignored by our Great community.

## Our Culture, Goals, Values and Stack

## Expected Behaviors

We expect participants to communicate professionally and thoughtfully. We call out common situations where it is especially important. For example: when people disagree, when people join a project midstream, when people are unclear in their communication style, and when you feel the need to leave the community. We expect participants in this community to conduct themselves professionally. Since our primary mode of communication is text on an online forum (e.g. issue, pull request, comment, email, or chat text) devoid of vocal tone, gestures, or other context that is often vital to understanding, it is especially important that you convey these attitudes in text. This includes the following behaviors:

**Assume positive intent.**
We may choose to disagree with the idea and reject the suggestion, but we expect that it was made in order to be supportive of the community goals.

**Respectful to participants.**
We expect that participants will disagree on aspects of this project. Disagreements must remain professional.

**Seek to understand.**
Ask, explore, challenge, and then assert if you agree or disagree.

**Welcoming to new members.**
New members bring fresh perspectives. Most will raise questions that have been addressed before. Don’t punish them for being new to the project -- everyone is new to every project once.

**Kind to beginners.**
Beginners use open source projects to get experience. They might not be talented coders yet, and projects should not accept poor quality code.

**Consider your impact on others.**
We expect community members to be considerate and establish a balance their self-interest with communal interest.

**Use words carefully.**
We may not understand intent when you say something ironic. We ask community members to communicate plainly.

**Exit with class.**
There may come a time where you stop believing in the project direction or get frustrated with the project leaders. You are always free to fork the code and create a competitive project. Open Source explicitly accommodates this. It does not have to be dramatic or bitter. Sometimes you just walk away, and it’s OK.


## Unacceptable Behaviors

We call out examples of behavior which cause members to lose their good standing in the community. These include insulting people on the basis of their protected-class status, threatening words, or unwanted sexual attention. Rather than fighting back, please report every incident directly to the project *Response Team*.  Participants in this open source community remain in good standing when they do not conduct themselves in a manner that violates this Code of Conduct. Misconduct includes:

Calling out project members by their identity or background in a deliberately negative or insulting manner. This includes but is not limited to slurs or insinuations related to protected or suspect classes such as race, color, citizenship, national origin, political belief, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, culture, ethnicity, genetic features, language, profession, membership of a national minority, mental or physical ability.
- Insulting remarks about a person’s lifestyle practices.
- Threats of violence or intimidation or any project member.
- Unwanted sexual attention or behavior unsuitable for the topic of the open source project.
- Sustained disruption of discussion.

We cannot list all forms of harassment in an exhaustive manner, nor do we seek to declare some forms of harassment as benign or not worthy of action. Rather, if a project member feels harassed we ask they report the incident. The incident will be recorded and addressed. Furthermore we insist that the victim of this harassment not address the issue in the forum in public, as this tends to intensify the problem for the parties in question and for the community as a whole.

## Reporting and Enforcement

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior—or have any other concerns—please report it with our [devChat](https://t.me/fuckgoogle).

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. If an individual engages in unacceptable behavior, the representative may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a permanent ban from our community without warning.
